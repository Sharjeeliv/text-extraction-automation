Equity markets in Germany and much of the rest of the world dipped lower at the beginning of the fourth quarter on concerns of slowing growth and rising inflation, but the markets bounced in November and December to register strong gains for the year. The MidCap Market Performance Index reached its highest level since 2000, as 2005 marked the sixth consecutive year that small and mid caps outperformed large caps. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the strongest performance for small and mid cap stocks in Germany was related to takeovers and takeover speculation.

It is expected that there will eventually be more people over the retirement age than of working age in Germany, which has significant implications for the German pension system. In short, Germans will need to supplement their public pensions with private savings. To help address this issue, the German government has created a new tax-deferred retirement savings vehicle to encourage its citizens to save for retirement. Beginning in 2005, Germans are eligible to deduct up to 12,000 euros in contributions. Over the next 20 years,\n",
      "the tax incentives will increase, creating increasing demand for private retirement savings products. As a result, the market for such products is expected to undergo sustained structural growth as Germans increasingly invest their personal savings in private retirement funds. The first signs of the impact of these reforms on the German financial sector should become visible in 2006 as companies begin to see increased demand for these products. In fact, in the year since the government introduced the new tax incentives, financial intermediaries have been adjusting their business models and hiring and training additional advisors in order to better service this growing market. Currently, companies that service wealthier clients are expected to be the primary beneficiaries, but as the impact of these reforms becomes more visible, the sector is expected to continue to evolve.

We see this as confirmation of our view that the global economy is in good shape, with moderate economic growth overall and limited inflationary threats. We believe the global macroeconomic environment is favourable for German equities. </font></p>\n",

      "<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:0pt; text-indent:0.14in;text-align:left;'><font size=1>Consumer confidence indicators surprised on the upside at the end of 2005, in part due to a moderate decline in unemployment. Nonetheless, private consumption is expected to remain sluggish in 2006, given that real wage growth remains modest. The 3% VAT hike scheduled to go into effect in January 2007 may provide an artificial boost to consumption in 2006 as purchases are brought forward to avoid the increased tax rate. German exports have grown 25% over the past five years and should continue to drive German growth in 2006. Investment in machinery and equipment improved in 2005 and may pick up further as increased confidence convinces cash-rich companies to invest. This is further supported by data showing that German manufacturing orders have soared due to strong external demand. </font></p>\n",

      "<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:0pt; text-indent:0.14in;text-align:left;'><font size=1>As 2005 came to a close, inflation registered at 2.1%. In 2006, inflation is likely to stay above the European Central Bank&#146;s (ECB) 2% target due to the impact of higher energy prices, though the core rate should remain contained. At its first meeting of the year, the ECB kept interest rates unchanged at 2.25%. We believe that the ECB is likely to raise rates by another 0.50% in the first half of 2006, with the next move likely to be a 0.25% hike in March. However, any signs of weakness in the economic indicators could cause the ECB to refrain from further rate hikes. A stabilizing interest rate differential with the United States should be supportive of the euro. </font></p>\n",

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</font></p>\n",

      "German equities posted double-digit gains in 2005, boosted by revitalized confidence in economic growth, subsiding inflation fears and increased risk appetite. Equity markets in Germany and much of the rest of the world dipped lower at the beginning of the fourth quarter on concerns of slowing growth and rising inflation, but the markets bounced in November and December to register strong gains for the year. The MidCap Market Performance Index reached its highest level since 2000, as 2005 marked the sixth consecutive year that small and mid caps outperformed large caps.

      "Answer: Germany, like many other countries, is expected to undergo a significant demographic shift over the next several decades that will drastically alter what is known as its dependency ratio (defined as the percentage of the population that is over 60 years old compared with the population that is between 15 and 59 years old). It is expected that there will eventually be more people over the retirement age than of working age in Germany, which has significant implications for the German pension system. In short, Germans will need to supplement their public pensions with private savings. To help address this issue, the German government has created a new tax-deferred retirement savings vehicle to encourage its citizens to save for retirement. Beginning in 2005, Germans are eligible to deduct up to 12,000 euros in contributions. Over the next 20 years,\n",
      "the tax incentives will increase, creating increasing demand for private retirement savings products. As a result, the market for such products is expected to undergo sustained structural growth as Germans increasingly invest their personal savings in private retirement funds. The first signs of the impact of these reforms on the German financial sector should become visible in 2006 as companies begin to see increased demand for these products. In fact, in the year since the government introduced the new tax incentives, financial intermediaries have been adjusting their business models and hiring and training additional advisors in order to better service this growing market. Currently, companies that service wealthier clients are expected to be the primary beneficiaries, but as the impact of these reforms becomes more visible, the sector is expected to continue to evolve.

      "Consumer confidence indicators surprised on the upside at the end of 2005, in part due to a moderate decline in unemployment. Nonetheless, private consumption is expected to remain sluggish in 2006, given that real wage growth remains modest. The 3% VAT hike scheduled to go into effect in January 2007 may provide an artificial boost to consumption in 2006 as purchases are brought forward to avoid the increased tax rate. German exports have grown 25% over the past five years and should continue to drive German growth in 2006. Investment in machinery and equipment improved in 2005 and may pick up further as increased confidence convinces cash-rich companies to invest. This is further supported by data showing that German manufacturing orders have soared due to strong external demand. \n",

      "As 2005 came to a close, inflation registered at 2.1%. In 2006, inflation is likely to stay above the European Central Bank’s (ECB) 2% target due to the impact of higher energy prices, though the core rate should remain contained. At its first meeting of the year, the ECB kept interest rates unchanged at 2.25%. We believe that the ECB is likely to raise rates by another 0.50% in the first half of 2006, with the next move likely to be a 0.25% hike in March. However, any signs of weakness in the economic indicators could cause the ECB to refrain from further rate hikes. A stabilizing interest rate differential with the United States should be supportive of the euro. \n",

      "The directors considered the management and investment advisory fee rates paid by the Fund to the Manager and Investment Adviser. The directors recognized that it is difficult to make comparisons of management and advisory fees because there are variations in the services that are included in the fees paid by other funds. The Fund’s peer group consisted of the 12 closed end country funds described above in “Investment Results.” The information showed that the Fund’s current effective management fee rate of 0.885% was the second lowest in the peer group and significantly below the average and the median for the peer group. The directors noted that the Fund’s effective fee rate reflects the effect of breakpoints. The directors also considered the total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison to the fees and expenses of funds within its peer group. The directors\n",

      "The directors noted that the management fee and investment advisery schedules for the Fund do contain breakpoints that reduce the fee rate on assets above specified levels. The directors recognized that breakpoints may be an appropriate way for the Manager and Investment Adviser to share its economies of scale with some funds that have substantial assets or that may grow materially over the next year. However, they also recognized that there is no direct relationship between the economies of scale realized by funds and those realized by the Manager and Investment Adviser as assets increase, largely because economies of scale are realized (if at all) by the Manager and Investment Adviser across a variety of products and services, and not only in respect of a single fund.
