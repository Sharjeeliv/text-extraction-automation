      "Recent months have revealed the fragility and disparity of the global economic recovery. In the U.S., the rate of economic growth has slowed as various stimulus programs have started to wind down, exposing weakness in the underlying economy. In contrast, many emerging market countries are experiencing a return to comparatively high rates of growth. Confidence in global financial markets has been undermined by concerns about high sovereign debt levels in Europe and the U.S. Until these countries can begin credible programs to reduce their budgetary deficits, market unease and hesitation will remain. On a more positive note, even though the countries now enjoying the strongest recovery depend on exports to countries with trade deficits, these importing countries have resisted the temptation to damage world trade by erecting trade barriers.\n",

The reduced issuance of tax-exempt municipal debt was due in part to the introduction of the Build America Bond program in 2009. Build America Bonds are a new class of taxable municipal debt, created as part of the February 2009 economic stimulus package. These bonds currently offer municipal issuers a federal subsidy equal to 35% of the bond’s interest payments, often times providing issuers with a lower cost alternative to traditional tax-exempt debt.

However, if taxable Build America Bond issuance were removed from the equation, the supply of tax-exempt bonds alone fell more than 4%. Demand for tax-exempt securities generally remained strong during this period, bolstered in part by the prospect of higher tax rates in the future.

Specifically, the amendment requires reporting entities disclose Level 3 activity for purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the Level 3 roll-forward on a gross basis rather than as one net number. The effective date of the amendment is for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
